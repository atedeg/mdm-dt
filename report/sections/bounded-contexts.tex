\section{Milk Planning}
% TODO: sistemare prevedendo i DT 
Every Saturday Raffaella has to estimate the quintals of milk necessary to produce all products
for the following week.
She makes this estimate by taking into account the following factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the quintals of milk processed in the same period of the previous year
    \item the quintals of milk needed by the products that have to be produced in the following week
    (this is made by reading from a recipe book the yield of milk to produce a quintal of a given product)
    \item the current stock
    \item the quintals of milk already in stock

\end{itemize}

After the estimate is complete the restocking B.C. is notified of the result so
that it can make a milk order

\subsection{Interaction with Milk Tank Digital Twin}
A milk tank is a machine that stores milk.
It has a sensor that measures the quantity of milk in the tank as well as temperature and pH value sensors.
It also has a valve that allows the milk to be pumped out of the tank.
The Milk Planning B.C. asks the Milk Tank DT for the milk level in order to estimate the quintals of milk necessary to produce
all products for the following week.
Temperature and pH values are used to analyze the milk quality.
Every time one of the two values above becomes out of range, a warning is sent to Alerts B.C.


\section{Stocking}
After a batch of cheeses has ripened for the required amount of time,
one of them is selected to perform quality assurance.
Its result could be either positive or negative.
The former results in the cheeses being wrapped, labeled and put in the refrigeration room;
the latter results in the entire batch being discarded.

To label a cheese the worker has to weigh it, and an automated system will print an appropriate label.

\subsubsection*{Scale DT}
A scale is a machine that provides the weight of the products.
It is used to weigh the products before they are stocked as a part of the quality assurance process.
Provides information about the current batch it is processing, the mean weight of the products in the batch and the standard deviation of the weight of the products in the batch.
It informs the Stocking B.C. that all of the packages of a batch have been scaled with the number of dropped packages (that is increased either if a product is overweight or underweight).

\section{Metal Detector DT}
Il fatto che il metal rilevi componenti metalliche è molto raro.
% questa cosa di seguito la mettiamo tra le motivazioni:
% Se accade  che il metal rilevi qualcosa voglio anche controllare i macchinari per vedere se c'è sono deterioramento etc.
Per tanto se l'evento accade , il batch viene scartato per ulteriori accertamenti sulla qualità dei prodotti.
Il batch scartato non viene propagato allo step successivo(bilancia).
L'evento di scarto del batch viene propagato allo Stocking.
