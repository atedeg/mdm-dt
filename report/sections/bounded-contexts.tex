\section{Milk Planning}
% TODO: sistemare prevedendo i DT 
Every Saturday Raffaella has to estimate the quintals of milk necessary to produce all products
for the following week.
She makes this estimate by taking into account the following factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the quintals of milk processed in the same period of the previous year
    \item the quintals of milk needed by the products that have to be produced in the following week
    (this is made by reading from a recipe book the yield of milk to produce a quintal of a given product)
    \item the current stock
    \item the quintals of milk already in stock

\end{itemize}

After the estimate is complete the restocking B.C. is notified of the result so
that it can make a milk order

\subsection{Interaction with Milk Tank Digital Twin}
A milk tank is a machine that stores milk.
It has a sensor that measures the quantity of milk in the tank as well as temperature and pH value sensors.
It also has a valve that allows the milk to be pumped out of the tank.
The Milk Planning B.C. asks the Milk Tank DT for the milk level in order to estimate the quintals of milk necessary to produce
all products for the following week.
Temperature and pH values are used to analyze the milk quality.
Every time one of the two values above becomes out of range, a warning is sent to Alerts B.C.


\section{Stocking}
After a batch of cheeses has ripened for the required amount of time,
one of them is selected to perform quality assurance.
Its result could be either positive or negative.
The former results in the cheeses being wrapped, labeled and put in the refrigeration room;
the latter results in the entire batch being discarded.

To label a cheese the worker has to weigh it, and an automated system will print an appropriate label.

\subsection{Interaction with quality assurance Digital Twins}

\subsubsection*{Scale DT}
A scale is a machine that provides the weight of the products.
It is used to weigh the products before they are stocked as a part of the quality assurance process.
Provides information about the current batch it is processing, the mean weight of the products in the batch and the standard deviation of the weight of the products in the batch.
It informs the Stocking B.C. that all of the packages of a batch have been scaled with the number of dropped packages (that is increased either if a product is overweight or underweight).

\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Metal Detector DT}
A metal detector is a machine that detects metal objects in the products.
It is used to check the products before they are stocked as a part of the quality assurance process.
The fact that the metal detector detects metal components is very rare so if the event occurs, the entire batch is discarded for further checks on the quality of the products.
The rejected batch is not propagated to the next step (scale).
It informs the Stocking B.C. that a batch has been rejected.

\section{Alerts}
Alerts is a B.C. that receives alerts from the other B.C. and from the Digital Twins.

From Maintenance B.C. receives the packaging machine maintenance event, which is a warning that the packaging machine is not working properly.

\subsection{Interaction with Digital Twins}
\subsubsection*{Packaging Machine DT}
A packaging machine is a machine that packages products.
It is used to package products before the quality assurance process.
It informs the Alerts B.C. that a package has been damaged or that the packaging machine has stopped working for some reason.

\subsubsection*{Milk Tank DT}
Informs the Alerts B.C. every time the pH value or the temperature value becomes out of range.

\section{Reporting}

It receives data from the scale (mean weight and standard deviation) and the metal detector (number of discarded packages) DTs.

\section{Maintenance}
This B.C. receives events from the Packaging Machine DT and uses the information to predict when the packaging machine will need maintenance.
It receives the events Packaging machine failure with the information regarding the batch id and the cutter temperature when the event has occurred, and the package damaged event with the same information.
When a prediction is ready, an event with the maintenance description is propagated to the alarm B.C.
